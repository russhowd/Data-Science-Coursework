    "## Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Following World War II the United States took a prominent role in foreign assistance efforts around the globe. Initially, international development assistance was in the form of financial and technical aid to European countries. Through the 1950's the process evolved into a foreign policy tool for the government. The United States attempted to diminish the threat of communism by promoting capitalism and create overseas markets by reducing poverty and increasing production in developing countries (USAID, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1961, the United States established the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This led to a change in foreign assistance. The aid shifted from capital and technical assistance programs to programs focused on basic human needs - such as nutrition, health, and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "USAID has prioritized different development approaches over the decades, and today their main objective \"is to support partners to become self-reliant and capable of leading their own development journeys\" (USAID, 2018). USAID balances a dual role of being a government policy tool promoting democracy and capitalist markets, while also providing assistance to help struggling countries with their own development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper seeks to explore this relationship. We will investigate where USAID provides foreign assistance funding and how much of the funding relates to the development indicators of these countries.\n"

    "## Literature Review <a name=\"lit_review\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief literature review was conducted to guide our research. We are most interested in previous studies that explored the relationship between aid for development versus foreign policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tomohisa Hattori explored foreign assistance as a moral practice and concluded that some foreign assistance, particularly grants by aid agencies, goes beyond the simple notion of reciprocity and is truly a contemporary form of benevolence (2003). A more recent study by Tobias Heinrich researched models to predict when foreign assistance was identified as selfless versus selfish (2013). He concluded that donor countries with greater awareness of the poverty-stricken recipient leads to selfless aid. Each of these studies lend support to our investigation as we would expect USAID, the development agency of a world hegemon, to provide foreign assistance to improve the well-being of populations without an expectation of explicit reciprocity through selfless giving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study is also inspired by a similar, political science investigation. McKinlay and Little developed a foreign policy model to explain the United States' bilateral aid allocation, attempting to explain if aid allocation is explained by the humanitarian need of the recipient or the foreign policy interest of the donor (1977). Their model concluded that the best explanation of aid allocation was related to imperialism, and thus, foreign policy interests. We will expand greatly on their methodology. McKinlay and Little only used a handful of economic indicators in their model - we will use a large variety of economic, social, and environmental indicators. Further, their study was conducted in 1977 and we will use present-day information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis technique is guided and adapted from the World Bank's famous country classifications based on income. The World Bank classifies countries into income groups based on gross national income per capita (Fantom and Serajuddin, 2016). We will use a similar approach and classify countries based on the amount of obligated aid received.\n"

    "## Research Question <a name=\"rq\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will investigate the relationship between the amount of USAID funding countries receive and their development indicators. We will attempt to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can we predict the amount of aid countries receive based on their country development profiles?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Based on USAIDs principles, we would expect that countries with similar economic, social, and infrastructure indicators would receive a similar amount in funding. This would suggest aid based on need. However, based on USAIDs additional role of being a foreign policy instrument, it is possible that the amount of aid that countries receive is not equivalent to their need. In this case, we would have difficulty predicting the amount of aid a country receives based solely on their development indicators.\n"

    "## Data Description <a name=\"data_descrp\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study will use data from multiple sources and combine them into a robust dataset for investigation. All data is open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, and by far the largest, dataset comes from USAID itself. USAID maintains an official record of all U.S. foreign aid on their foreign aid explorer website (FAE, 2019). The full dataset has been downloaded and will be explored in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset comes from Joni Hoppen, who compiled a dataset of 65 world indexes and indicators for 188 countries and shared through kaggle.com (Hoppen, 2017). While substantial, this dataset has many old values and some of the categories are unclear. We will only use a fraction of the categories from this data. Index categories, such as the Gini coefficient and consumer price index, are not present in our other datasets so we will take them from this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our third dataset comes from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). Similar to USAID, the UN maintains a data service explorer. UNData combines more than 20 statistical sources compiled by UNSD and other international organisations (UNData, 2019). It is incredibly thorough and these statistics are the bulk of our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final dataset we include is the 2017 World Happiness Report. The World Happiness Report has been constructed every year since 2012 by the UN using Gallup World Poll survey data in 156 countries (WHR, 2019). The report reviews the state of happiness around the world and establishes an index for each country between 0 (unhappy) and 10 (happy). While the methodology and metrics of the report are contentious, it is a unique index we can include as a proxy for overall well-being for the countries we investigate."

    "\n",
    "Before we begin our investigation into the foreign assistance amounts and other data attributes, we must import and clean our CSV data. In order to conduct proper analysis we must validate all of our data, ensure consistency with naming conventions (such as country names), and handle null values. We will import each dataset one at a time and perform these activities. Finally, we will merge them altogether into a single dataset. We will perform additional data munging activities on the merged data related to restructuring our data and create new categories. \n",

    "The first data mining technique we will attempt is exploratory clustering. We gain new insights into our data by clustering aspects of it and it allows data exploration to go a step further. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique and will produce results that are not apparent beforehand. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate the clustering of countries based on values. We will perform two types of clustering - K-means and DBSCAN - and identify which is the stronger the method. \n",

    "\n",
    "We want to include the aid amount received in our analysis because that is what we are chiefly concerned with. Our dataset also contains a number of indexes, such as Gender Inequality, Gini Coefficient, and Consumer Price Index, but the Happiness Index is unique in that it attempts to capture the holistic wellbeing of populations based on survey data. We will use that as our second attribute as we would expect a relationship between how much aid a country receives and overall wellbeing/happiness of the population. From our previous correlation matrix we can see that these two attributes have a negative correlation, suggesting that as happiness increases the amount of aid obligated decreases. \n",

In K-means, cluster centroids are placed randomly within space and points are assigned to that cluster based on proximity to the centroid. After that step, the centroids are recalculated as the new cluster mean. The process continues until the centroids no longer change. The method is quite painless, intuitive, and easy to interpret.  \n",

The user must specify the number of clusters before running the algorithm (unlike DBSCAN) and it will place all points within a cluster, even if the data itself is unclustered. Uneven sized clusters also cause issues as the centroids may be pulled to the high density areas. \n",

    "We will conduct three types of classification and compare their performance to identify the strongest method - (1) nearest neighbours, (2) support vector machines, and (3) random forests. Unfortunately, our classification is multi-dimensional which makes visualisation of the results difficult. However, we will use statistical validation measures (Precision, Recall, and F1) to gauge which classifier performs the best. These measures compare the predicted classes against actual, observed classes. \n",

    "To classify our data, first we must create the classes. \n",

    "\n",
    "As these categories do not exist in our data, we must first create these labels in our dataset before moving into the individual classification methods. This approach is inspired by the classification technique that the World Bank conducts to classify countries into income groups based on gross national income per capita. \n",

    "To make our classification analysis more refined it is a best practice to conduct some feature selection. We have 27 columns of numeric, attribute data that we will use in our classification. However, not all attributes are helpful. Attributes with low variance may add noise to our models and impact how it performs. Therefore, it is a good idea to remove attributes that will not be useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will perform a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of our attributes to identify the most important components. PCA reduces the complexity of datasets by combining attributes into the most important elements. These combined attributes capture much of the variance within the dataset and reduces the impact of less useful attributes. The main downside to PCA is that it produces components that are very difficult to interpret because the created components are dimensions of the data that maximise variance, but do not explicitly correspond with any of our initial categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare our data for PCA, we must first standardise our attributes. Just like clustering, we must be able to compare our attributes of different scales and values. As before, we will standardise our attribute data with Z-score scaling. This method establishes the difference from the mean of each category and then scales by standard deviation. This method is particularly useful when there are outliers in the data, which we know exist from our clustering analysis and boxplot.\n",

    "Nearest neighbours (also known as k-NN) classification considers neighbouring points and their classifications. Test points are classified according to proximity to points seen during the method training. Classification is computed from a majority vote of the nearest neighbours of each point and is then assigned to the majority class. \n",

    "Unlike our clustering techniques, scikit contains an incredibly useful parameter sweep tool called GridSearchCV that can be used to test various classification parameters. It outputs the best parameter settings based on cross-validation - a vital model refinement tool to judge the measure of fit.

This helps avoid the potential problems of overfitting or selection bias. \n",

Although PCA improved the performance for k-NN and SVC classification, we will not use it for our Random Forest classification.\n",

    "A review of the classification metrics of our three models - k-NN, SVC, and Random Forest - suggests that we can marginally predict, or classify, the amount of aid received by countries based on their country indicators. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the overall accuracy score of our classifiers can be misleading, we will judge our models based on the precision, recall, and F1 metrics: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Precision: Calculates how many of the predicted classes are actually that class. A strong determination measure when False                  Positive costs are high.  \n",
    "* Recall: Calculates how many of the true classes our model labels as the correct class. A strong determination measure when               False Negative costs are high.  \n",
    "* F1: A measure that balances precision and recall results. It is particularly useful with uneven class distributions, which           our models had.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, Random Forest mostly outperformed in all categories. The only exception is that the SVC model had a higher overall precision score, but only by 0.05. Random Forest did have the highest overall accuracy as well (68%). \n",
    "\n",
    "The SVC and k-NN model performed about the same, each with 64% accuracy. Each had the greatest difficulty with the \"Low\" and \"High\" obligation categories. Of the two, SVC had greater success predicting the \"Medium\" category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Random Forest model was the strongest performer with 68% accuracy and the highest average recall and F1 scores. However, it also struggled predicting the \"Low\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can conclude that our Random Forest model was the strongest classifier. We can also be confident that our data was not overfit to the model because we used cross validation results to choose our best model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our research question, if we can predict the amount of aid countries receive based on their country development profiles, cannot be answered definitively. Using our Random Forest model we can predict with 68% accuracy the aid obligation category that countries receive based on their development indicators. Perhaps our trouble in classification indicates that aid is obligated by foreign policy interests rather than development needs. However, the moderate success of our classification shows that development indicators certainly have an impact.\n"
